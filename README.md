# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview

This project will analyze Pyber ridesharing company 2019 data. On this analysis we will explore the consumer behavior and economic trends, applying Python Matplotlib skills in order to clearly show possible improvements on the access to ride-sharing service. Determining affordability and trending areas, comparing city types such as urban, suburban, and rural and evaluating the correlation on number of rides and impact on the fares based on the area rideshare served.


# Results of analysis

## Ride Counts by City type

In order to have a closer look on the total counts of ride by city type it was extracted the following charts:

We can observe with this information that count data includes an outlier with 39 rides in one city. When looking at rural cities the average number of riders is on the range of 4 times lower than urban cities and 3.5 times lower than suburban cities. Taking the same perspective but focus on the Pie chart we can relate similar information, the urban cities have the highest percentage of the total, representing 68.4% of the rides, simultaneously suburban cities represent 26.3% and rural 5.3% of the total rides.

## Driver Counts by City types

After exanimating the charts below we can determine that the average of suburban drivers is 4 times higher than the number of rural drivers. We can also see that in this case we not have outliers, informing that the urban cities have the higher percentage representing 80.9% of total rides and suburban 16.5% and rural 2.6% respectively.




## Fare Counts by City Type

On these charts we get a closer look on total and weekly fares by city type, we do not have outliers on fares analysis. 
Facing the results of the extracted data we could see that the average fare for rides was rural cities $36.00, urban cities $25.00 and suburban cities $31.00. As in the ridesharing metrics the fare prices are based on supply and demand we can see that on the Rural cities the fares have a superior amount then the city types compared on this analysis. As shown on the pie chart the larger percentage represents one more time urban cities with 62.7% of total and rural cities once again on the lowest percentage of total representing 6.8%.


## Overview by City types

As demonstrated on the chart below we can identify the total number of rides per city, the total number of drivers per city and the average fare per city.
The circle size represents the driver count per city.

#Summary


It became clear with the extraction of the data that the urban cities surpass the additional cities compared, representing the larger revenue. Taking in account that urban areas most likely to have a bigger population and are concentrated and a smaller area size, we can see that reflects on the ride numbers. There is a trend that can be further explored as we can see that we have an increase on the second half of February for total fares proportionally.

With a larger data point, probably the last 2 years information. This analysis could dive further on specific trends yearly and maybe point out more options of service areas in addition to strategic advice on marketing campaigns based on the population target. 

As per the analysis of Pyber ridesharing services the suburban drivers were only about 17% of the total drivers but accounted for more than 30% of the total fares and just above a quarter of the rides. If financially possible to improve the access to PyBer service in those areas it could generate incentives, such as loyalty programs and discount for first users on a determined area. I order to have more riders to join in, if the fare charge get review and possibly lower costed, we could probably have a better outcome when customer choose the ridesharing service.
Additional analysis including geographic size, population and social conditions, travel distances would be recommended in order to have this changes positively working.
